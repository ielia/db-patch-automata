Known Bugs and Limitations
==========================

- Under certain conditions, the file ~/.pgpass may have the configured
  passwords appended.
- Wrong password in ~/.pgpass prevent access to the databases, no matter what
  password have been configured in the patch_automata.
- Database patches that use "exec_sql_and_commit" may cause trouble to roll
  back and run again.
- Patches that have collateral effects may cause trouble to roll back and run
  again.
- When in trouble, take a look into the pg_prepared_xacts of each PostgreSQL
  server to see what transactions are prepared into which database and either
  commit them or roll them back, depending on your status and needs.
