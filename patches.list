#
# The charater '@' is a MISCELLANEOUS encapsulator. Each MISCELLANEOUS can be a
# dependency of a patch or depend on it. You can have both types of
# dependencies on the same line, thus can have up to two "MISCs" in each line.
# MISCs are always related to a patch in the same line, and can't have more
# than one PATCH per line.
# If you need to add '@' or '\' into them you must escape these characters
# using the '\' character.
# Line feed characters inside the MISCELLANEOUS have to be written as '\n'.
# COMMENTARIES should begin with '#' character and can't be added at end of the
# line.
#
#
# Line example: 
#     #commentary           - commentary line (not read by the patch automata).
#     patch                 - patch without misc dependencies.
#     @misc@ patch          - indicates that misc must have been executed
#                             before patch (this is called "misc-patch
#                             dependency", thus patch depends upon misc).
#     patch @misc@          - indicates that misc must be executed after
#                             patch (this is called "patch-misc dependency",
#                             thus misc depends upon patch).
#     @misc1@ patch @misc2@ - indicates that misc1 must have been executed
#                             before patch, and patch must be executed before
#                             misc2 (this is called "misc-patch-misc
#                             dependency", thus misc2 depends upon patch, that
#                             depends upon misc1).
#     otherwise: Malformed line.
