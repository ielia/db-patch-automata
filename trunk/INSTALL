INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Have the following Perl modules installed:
  - DBI
  - DBD::Pg
  - IPC::Open2

Have a main database (${PG_PATCHMANAGER_DB*}) where to put this patches table:
  CREATE TABLE environmentpatch(
    patch VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    source VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    executiontime TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    status INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    CONSTRAINT PRIMARY KEY (patch)
  );

Be sure 'max_prepared_transactions' in PostgreSQL configuration has a value set
accordingly. Remember that the patch_runner prepares a transaction for every
exec_sql call to each database.
